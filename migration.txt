Option 2: Full Migration (Recommended)

Migration Plan for Cashmash Backend:

1. Infrastructure Components:
   - Keep: nginx (configure as reverse proxy for Node.js)
   - Keep: MySQL 8.0 (database remains the same)
   - Replace: PHP components with Node.js/Express backend
   - Add: Node.js runtime environment

2. Backend Technology Stack:
   - Primary: Node.js with Express.js or Fastify
   - Language: TypeScript (aligns with frontend)
   - Database: Continue using MySQL 8.0
   - ORM: Prisma (recommended for TypeScript integration)

3. Database Management Tools:
   - Keep: phpMyAdmin (still works with MySQL regardless of backend)
   - Add: Prisma Studio (for Node.js development workflow)
   - Alternative: Adminer (lighter than phpMyAdmin if preferred)

4. API Architecture:
   - Implement RESTful API endpoints
   - Use JWT for token-based authentication
   - Design mobile-optimized endpoints for React Native app

5. Deployment Configuration:
   - Configure nginx as reverse proxy to forward requests to Node.js app
   - Maintain phpMyAdmin accessibility for database management
   - Set up PM2 or similar for Node.js process management

6. Benefits of This Approach:
   - Leverages existing MySQL database
   - Maintains familiar database management tools
   - Aligns with React Native app requirements
   - Provides modern API architecture for mobile app
   - Allows for shared type definitions between frontend and backend
   - Enables better development workflow with TypeScript

7. Implementation Steps:
   - Install Node.js runtime on VPS
   - Set up Express.js/TypeScript backend project
   - Configure nginx to proxy API requests to Node.js
   - Install Prisma and set up database connection
   - Develop API endpoints for mobile app
   - Test integration between mobile app and new backend
